Defaults to 0.\nstop: stop tracking at stop seconds.  Defaults to 86399.999 seconds (24 hours minus one millisecond).\ntarget_width: the full width of the target (diameter, not radius). It is used as the FWHM of the center Gaussian in the DoG filter. Arbitrarily defaults to 25 pixels.\nstart_location: one of the following:\nmissing: the target will be detected in a large (quarter the frame size) window centered at the frame.\nCartesianIndex{2}: the Cartesian index (into the image matrix) indicating where the target is at start. Note that when the aspect ratio of the video is not equal to one, this Cartesian index should be to the raw, unscaled, image frame.\nNTuple{2}: (x, y) where x and y are the horizontal and vertical pixel-distances between the left-top corner of the video-frame and the target at start. Note that regardless of the aspect ratio of the video, this coordinate should be to the scaled image frame (what you'd see in a video player).\nDefaults to missing.\nwindow_size: Defaults to a good minimal size that depends on the target width (see guess_window_size for details). But can be one of the following:\nNTuple{2}: a tuple (w, h) where w and h are the width and height of the window (region of interest) in which the algorithm will try to detect the target in the next frame. This should be larger than the target_width and relate to how fast the target moves between subsequent frames. \nInt: both the width and height of the window (region of interest) in which the algorithm will try to detect the target in the next frame. This should be larger than the target_width and relate to how fast the target moves between subsequent frames. \ndarker_target: set to true if the target is darker than its background, and vice versa. Defaults to true.\nfps: frames per second. Sets how many times the target's location is registered per second. Set to a low number for faster and sparser tracking, but adjust the window_size accordingly. Defaults to an arbitrary value of 24 frames per second.\ndiagnostic_file: specify a file path to save a diagnostic video showing a low-memory version of the tracking video with the path of the target superimposed on it. Defaults to nothing.\n\nReturns a vector with the time-stamps per frame and a vector of Cartesian indices for the detection index per frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"95-reference/#PawsomeTracker.track-Tuple{AbstractVector}","page":"Reference","title":"PawsomeTracker.track","text":"track(files::AbstractVector; start::AbstractVector, stop::AbstractVector, target_width, start_location::AbstractVector, window_size, darker_target, fps, diagnostic_file)\n\nUse a Difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter to track a target across multiple video files. start, stop, and start_location all must have the same number of elements as files does.
